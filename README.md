# Data Science Specialization Community Mentor Content Repository

Author: Len Greski

This repository contains content developed during my time as either a student or Community Mentor in the Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University that is offered over [Coursera](http://coursera.org). A number of people have developed content to help students work through the nine courses in the specialization. The main index for this content is [datasciencespecialization.github.io](http://datasciencespecialization.github.io/).


# Repository Contents

As a participant and TA in courses in the curriculum, there are patterns of similar issues experienced by students. Migrating the content to github will facilitate reposting it to new runs of courses within the curriculum. This will make it easier for students to have access to the experiences from prior students without me having to cut and paste the content into Discussion Forums, which are the primary mechanism for communication between students and with TAs.
