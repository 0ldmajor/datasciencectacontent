# Data Science Specialization: Course Prerequisites and Difficulty Levels

Students in the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization on Coursera frequently ask about the feasibility of taking multiple courses simultaneously. An answer to this question includes two elements:

1. Prerequisites: what is the logical sequencing of the courses?
2. Difficulty levels: how much effort must I invest into a particular course?

## Prerequisites

Generally speaking, JHU expects that all students take *The Data Scientist's Toolbox* prior to any other courses. Course assignments in *Toolbox* are designed to ensure that students already have working versions of R, RStudio, Rtools, and Devtools on their computers prior to the start of *R Programming*. Also, the final project requires students to obtain a Github account, and to complete basic Git / Github tasks, including:

* Create a repository in Github,
* Create a local copy of a Github repository,
* Create a file on a local copy of a Github repository, and
* Push the locally-created file to the remote Github repository.

I have seen numerous students struggle with the Git / Github work in the second programming assignment in *R Programming* because they had not completed *Toolbox* prior to the start of *R Programming*.

Next, students should complete *R Programming* before taking any other course(s) in the Specialization. Since all other classes require extensive use of R, it's important to understand the core concepts covered in *R Programming* before taking on other courses.

* Basic R: syntax, objects, programming style
* Loading raw data into R (required for quiz 1)
* Lexical scoping (the focus of second programming assignment)
* Essential programming concepts: loops, conditionals, etc.
* Creating R functions

Finally, students must complete nine courses prior to enrolling in the *Capstone* course, where students must build a predictive model application using R and Shiny. While there are no other prerequisites stated for individual courses, practically speaking there is a logical order to the courses that implies some additional prerequsites. Prerequisites for the entire curriculum are listed in the following table.

<table>
<tr><th>Course</th><th>Prerequisites</th></tr>
<tr><td>1. The Data Scientist's Toolbox </td><td>No prerequisites -- this is the first course in the curriculum, and students are expected to start here.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2. R Programming </td><td>Students should complete <em>Toolbox</em> before starting <em>R Programming</em>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3. Getting and Cleaning Data </td><td>Students should complete <em>R Programming</em> before starting <em>Getting and Cleaning Data</em>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4. Exploratory Data Analysis </td><td>Students should complete <em>R Programming</em> before starting <em>Exploratory Data Analysis</em>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5. Reproducible Research </td><td>Students are expected to include exploratory data analysis in the final project for this course, so they should complete <em>Exploratory Data Analysis</em> prior to taking this course, or at least take it concurrently.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6. Statistical Inference </td><td>Students should complete <em>R Programming</em> before starting <em>Statistical Inference</em>. For students that have no prior background in statistics, additional sources of help are listed in the article <a href="http://bit.ly/2c50sKo">References for Statistical Inference</a>.</td></tr>

## Course Difficulty levels

<table>
<tr><th>Course</th><th>Comments</th></tr>
<tr><td>1. Capstone </td><td>This course is the most challenging one in the specialization for two reasons. First, it requires knowledge from all prior courses. Second, it provides a challenging final project that requires many hours of independent work. Each week's lecture is between 1 and 3 minutes long, leaving the student to figure out many concepts in the domain of natural language processing on his / her own. </td></tr>
<tr><td>2. Statistical Inference </td><td>For students that don't already have a background in inferential statistics, this is by far the most difficult course in the curriculum. Students often report on the discussion forums having to repeat it multiple times to understand the concepts well enough to pass the quizzes and complete the final project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3. R Programming </td><td>This course is close in difficulty to <em>Statistical Inference</em> because most students in the Specialization don't have a programming background. Additionally, students who learned another statistics language by taking university-level statistics courses often are <a href="http://bit.ly/2erxk3A">frustrated by the abstract nature of R.</a><br><br>The first programming assignment is very difficult for students who don't already have a programming background, including tasks that are significantly more difficult than those typically required of students in an graduate-level introductory statistics class in the biomedical or social sciences. </td></tr>
<tr><td>4. Regression Models</td><td>Once students pass <em>Statistical Inference</em>, this course seems less difficult. However, the lectures include a fair amount of statistical theory (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares">Ordinay Least Squares</a>) including derivations of various formulas. </td></tr>
<tr><td>5. Practical Machine Learning</td><td>The difficulty level in this course is driven by the challenge of the course project, as well as the fact that changes in R packages for the various machine learning algorithms used in the course make it difficult for students to exactly match answers to the quiz questions. The course project difficultly level was reduced significantly after the publication of <a href="http://bit.ly/2bYtutG">Improving Performance of Random Forest with caret::train()</a>, which provides step by step instructions for using parallel processing in machine learning algorithms. Also contributing to difficulty in this course is the requirement for students to <a href="http://bit.ly/2bTvGqr">publish their final assignments as Github pages websites.</a> </td></tr>
<tr><td>6. Getting and Cleaning Data</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>7. Reproducible Research</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>8. Developing Data Products</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>9. Exploratory Data Analysis</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>10. The Data Scientist's Toolbox</td><td>Concepts and assignments are very straightforward (i.e. download software from CRAN, create Github account, etc.) and the course could be finished in a day or two of concerted effort.</td></tr>
