## Forms of the Extract Operator in R

The `extract` operator is used to retrieve data from objects in R. The operator may take four forms, including `[, [[, $,` and `@`. The fourth form, `@`, is called the slot operator, and is used to extract content from an object built with the S4 object system, also known as a *formally defined object*. Use of the S4 object system is a more advanced topic so we won't discuss it further here.
