# Statistical Inference: Statistics References

Students in the Statistical Inference Course within the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization on coursera.org are often interested in finding additional references to support the content delivered in the Statistical Inference Course.

<table>
<tr><th>Reference</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://leanpub.com/LittleInferenceBook"> Statistical Inference for Data Science </a></td><td>Start here! Written by Brian Caffo, the instructor for *Statistical Inference* this is the book that is designed to accompany the Johns Hopkins University *Statistical Inference* course, and it's available for low (or no) cost on leanpub.org. </td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://openintro.org/stat"> OpenIntro Statistics </a></td><td>Openintro.org provides a set of three statistics courses that include books and videos.  </td></tr>
<tr><td> <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/r-in-action-second-edition"> R in Action</a></td><td>Written by Robert Kabacoff, *R in Action* is an excellent overall reference for R, written by a statistician. It includes code and detailed explanations of a variety of techniques used in the *Statistical Inference* course, such as basic statistics, t-tests, comparing multiple groups, and power analysis.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="http://statmethods.net/stats/index.html"> Statmethods.net Basic Statistics Page</a> </td><td>Also developed by Robert Kabacoff, statmethods.net is the online companion to *R in Action*. It contains content about a variety of statistical methods., as well as a list of <a href="http://statmethods.net/about/books.html"> additional books and tutorials </a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>[Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org)</td><td>Wikipedia is always a great place to start when one needs to answer some questions about a statistical method. For example, the link on the [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) is useful for one of the two components of the *Statistical Inference* course project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>[The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)</td><td>ESL is very useful as a supplement to the *Practical Machine Learning* course later in the Data Science Specialization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>[Schaum's Outline of Statistics](http://www.amazon.com/Schaums-Outline-Statistics-5th-Outlines/dp/0071822526/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&dpID=51OueXR42uL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL320_SR238%2C320_&refRID=11YKF2R7S40J9RPMM4WP)</td><td>Having relied on *Schaum's Outlines* to get me through engineering calculus when I was in college, I've always appreciated the problem solving approach in the Schaum's books. The *Statistics Outline (Fifth Edition)* includes more than 500 fully solved problems, examples, and practice exercises. it also includes access to detailed videos that are related to the problems.</td><tr>
