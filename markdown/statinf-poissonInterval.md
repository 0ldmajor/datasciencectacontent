# Calculating Poisson Confidence Interval Explained

In February 2017 a student in the Johns Hopkins University *Statistical Inference* course requested a more verbose explanation of the content on calculating a confidence interval for the mean of a Poisson random variable. Specifically he wanted more detail regarding the content on slides 26 - 27 of the *Asymptopia* lecture.
