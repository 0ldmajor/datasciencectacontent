# StormData Analysis: A Comprehensive Guide

The course project for *Reproducible Research* is an assignment that tests the limits of the skills students develop during the first five courses in the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization on Coursera.

Arguably, this is the first course project in the sequence that requires students to combine what they've learned in data cleaning, R programming, and exploratory data analysis into a research product: an analysis of the 2011 National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) *StormData* database.

There are four major categories of problems with the NOAA data that give students fits as they work to complete the assignment. In descending order of severity, they are:

1. Changing data collection methods over time, <br><br>
2. Poor quality of data, including what Hadley Wickham would call ["untidy" data](http://bit.ly/2nyw5Ci), <br><br>
3. Low quality, disorganized documentation, and <br><br>
4. Large data size.

A number of articles to help students complete the assignment have been posted by Community Mentors on the *Reproducible Research* Discussion Forums. These articles usually provide tactical support to the students, helping them solve specific areas of ambiguity with the assignment, such as what the numbers, + and - signs, and letters H, K, M, and B mean in the `PROPDMGEXP` and `CROPDMGEXP` variables.

In *StormData Analysis: A Comprehensive Guide*, we will provide a "big picture" review of the four problems articulated above, so students can spend more of their time working with the data and less of their time running into the same roadblocks that have faced past students.
