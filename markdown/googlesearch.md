If necessary, put your hacker skills to work by making Google your friend. For example, if you're trying to solve the *R Programming* class Assignment 1, some of the following Google queries might be helpful:

* [list files in r](http://www.google.com/search?q=list+files+in+r)
* [subset data frame by list of values](http://www.google.com/search?subset+data+frame+by+list+of+values)
* [missing values in R](http://www.google.com/search?missing+values+in+r)

And yes, I did have to do some hacking around myself to figure out how to embed Google searches in this article.
